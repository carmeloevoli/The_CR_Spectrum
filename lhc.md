# About the LHC energy

The most powerful particle accelerator in operation today is the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which accelerates proton beams to energies of up to $E = 7$ TeV per beam.

Given that the mass of a proton is approximately 1 GeV, the Lorentz factor is $\gamma = \frac{E}{m} \sim 7 \times 10^3$, placing us well within the ultra-relativistic regime where the kinetic energy far exceeds the rest mass energy of the particles.

To describe the collision between two particles with energies $E_1$ and $E_2$, and an incident angle $\theta$, we can define the Lorentz-invariant quantity:

$$
s = (E_1 + E_2)^2 - (\mathbf{p_1} + \mathbf{p_2})^2
$$

Expanding this expression gives:

$$
s = m_1^2 + m_2^2 + 2 (E_1 E_2 - |\mathbf{p_1}| |\mathbf{p_2}| \cos \theta)
$$

In the ultra-relativistic limit, where the particle masses are negligible compared to their energies, this simplifies to:

$$
s \approx 2 E_1 E_2 (1 - \cos \theta)
$$

For the specific case of identical particles with equal momentum colliding head-on (such as in the LHC), where $\theta = 180^\circ$, the center of mass (COM) frame coincides with the lab frame. In this case, the invariant simplifies to:

$$
s \approx 4 E^2
$$

This leads to the center of mass energy at the LHC being:

$$
\sqrt{s}_{\rm LHC} \sim 14 \, \text{TeV}
$$

This is the energy available for new particle production in LHC collisions.

Now, let’s consider the case of cosmic rays. What is the cosmic ray energy $E_{\rm CR}$ required to produce a center of mass energy comparable to that of the LHC?

For a fixed target scenario—such as when a cosmic ray collides with a proton at rest in the atmosphere—the invariant $s$ is given by:

$$
s = 2 E_{\rm CR} m_p
$$

Equating this to the center of mass energy of the LHC, we find:

$$
E_{\rm CR} \sim 10^8 \text{ GeV}
$$

Thus, a cosmic ray with an energy of approximately $10^8$ GeV is required to achieve a center of mass energy similar to that produced in the LHC.
